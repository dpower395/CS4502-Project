### Project Title: 
An Analysis of New York City’s Parking Violations for Fiscal Year 2022

### Project Description:
This project seeks to examine parking violations in New York City’s five boroughs for the fiscal year 2022, and explore the various factors which may influence or contribute to those violations. Using data provided through the Open Data project of New York City’s Department of Finance, the authors seek to answer such questions as 'When during the year are most tickets likely to be issued?' and 'Is there a correlation between out-of-state license plates and violations on certain streets?' The answers to these questions could hold significance not only for the wary automobilist seeking to avoid hefty fines, but also for the policymakers who must make sound decisions on public safety transportation strategies. For example, by far the most likely street for out-of-state license plate parking violations is West 14th Street, so it could be reasonably concluded that this street is a hot spot for tourists in the city. It would be useful, then, for travel guides to mention that tourists should be wary of parking along this street while visiting the city. In this way, the questions analyzed in this paper could be used to improve the overall state of transportation and traffic in the city.

### Questions:
Which streets or locations have the most number of parking tickets?<br />
What are the most common violation codes issued? Is there a correlation for certain types of vehicles?<br />
Which counties have the highest number of parking violations?<br />
When during the year are most tickets likely to be issued?<br />
Which make of passenger vehicle is most likely to be ticketed?<br />

### Answers:
In the Manhattan borough, E West 14th street is by far the most common street for receiving parking violations.<br />
The most common violation codes are 36 (Exceeding the posted speed limit in or near a designated school zone) and 21 (Street Cleaning). The most common type of vehicles ticketed are suburban vehicles and four door sedans.<br />
Predictably, Manhattan has the highest rate of parking violations.<br />
Parking violations are enforced regularly throughout the year, though a regular drop at certain parts of the week / year are due to days when violations are not enforced.<br />
There is a statistically significant difference between how often foreign and domestic cars are ticketed, with foreign cars being ticketed disproportionately more than they are registered in NY. This could be an issue with our data or an enforcement bias.<br />

### Applications:
Any effort made to increase awareness about the restrictions of passenger vehicles along stretches of West 14th Street might go a long way towards preventing negligent parking.

Another potential application of our gathered data could be aimed at reducing the violations for parking code 36 (exceeding the posted speed limit in or near a designated school zone), which is the most common violation for both vehicles registered within and out of New York. Since this violation occurs at a significantly higher rate than any other violation, focusing on this specific type of violation could have the highest potential impact in reducing overall parking violations.
