###Project Description:
This project seeks to examine parking violations in New York City’s five boroughs for the fiscal year 2022, and explore the various factors which may influence or contribute to those violations. Using data provided through the Open Data project of New York City’s Department of Finance, the authors seek to answer such questions as 'When during the year are most tickets likely to be issued?' and 'Is there a correlation between out-of-state license plates and violations on certain streets?' The answers to these questions could hold significance not only for the wary automobilist seeking to avoid hefty fines, but also for the policymakers who must make sound decisions on public safety transportation strategies. For example, by far the most likely street for out-of-state license plate parking violations is West 14th Street, so it could be reasonably concluded that this street is a hot spot for tourists in the city. It would be useful, then, for travel guides to mention that tourists should be wary of parking along this street while visiting the city. In this way, the questions analyzed in this paper could be used to improve the overall state of transportation and traffic in the city.

Questions:
Which streets or locations have the most number of parking tickets?
What are the most common violation codes issued? Is there a correlation for certain types of vehicles?
Which counties have the highest number of parking violations?
What are the most common parking violations for each plate type?
